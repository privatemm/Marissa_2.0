                    <li>I am an angel intuitive. In readings I see your aura, animate it in a drawing and help you move in a transformative direction toward better mind body & spirit health. </li>

                    <li>I use intuitive energy therapy, a gift given to me by our Creator to heal, help you heal and have tools to move forward in working on yourself independently. Marissa will be teaching you, guiding you, and working on you.

                    <li>You can start with a package deal. First time members receive a discounted package with their first visit as a gift of beginning true healing and learning. A reading of the aura ( the multilayered energy field around you which answers many questions about your health & blockages in everyday living ) is included in your first reiki energy healing. The first step is usually the one we are most unconfident about making. However, you have to weigh what is most important. What is most important is YOU. Your health is going to improve when you take the first step and relax as you go on a restorative journey in which you close your eyes and enjoy the haven of healing crystals and meditative music on your meditative journey as our master practitioner works.  Your centers of power are “chakras.”</li>

                <h2 class="text-center">HEALTHY CHAKRAS MEANS VITALITY & SELF DISCOVERY</h2>
 <p>There are seven most commonly known chakras. These seven chakras are vital to our health. Negative feelings hamper the energetic differences of these chakras, resulting in sickness and disease. A chakra is a vital energy center that resides in our bodies, that is not detectable by most modern medical means.</p>
<p>Starting above your head is your center of life purpose which often looks like a ball of light when healthy, and is a link to your higher self’s growth. Learn about your chakras HERE (Linked to chakra pg on blog). They start above your head and end below your feet, and in Reiki and other energetic healings such as Bioenergetic healing with crystals, these centers are cleansed of blockages and negative energy that we pick up in our daily lives, and crystalized in a Heavenly healing light through a process of energetic Reiki healing. If the energy that flows in your chakras is not moving properly you could feel a range of blockages in your life from depression, to being unable to express yourself properly, anxiety, physical pain or discomfort, feeling uneasy around people or a sense of dread, or feeling like you have hit a wall. If you are feeling anything like these symptoms you may be going through a transformation. One in which you are aware of what is going on with you- meaning you have started down a path and are beginning a transformation! By regaining strength through Reiki, your vital energy restoration will begin a transformation.</p>

                <h3 class="text-center">What is vital energy?</h3>
<p>Vital energy is our true essence. It's our pure and perfect spirits...the joining of our masculine and the feminine energy dancing a perfect dance of harmony and balance. Once we close this gap, we will no longer have limitations or need for physical sustenance, because God's Light will then reach us and sustain us.
It's amazing how cultures who never crossed paths can be so similar in their beliefs. People around the world are familiar with vital energy or kundalini. This energy is known as prana in Sanskirt, chi in China, ki in Japan, and gal in Galic. To the Maya coyopa, translated to "lightning in the blood," represents this vital energy.
It's the rising upward of this vital energy that was predicted by the Maya for us. This energy rises because our level of consciousness and understanding has risen, causing movement upward through the seven different chakras. 
It's time to release this old denied charge that has built up within us, and becoming a whole person, who not only "thinks" but "feels." It's about bringing the masculine and feminine energies together at the heart and closing the gap that separates them. It's realizing we are only complete when we have both energies working together instead of against each other.

    <p>"To be Quetzalcoatl or Kukulcan is to know the seven forces (seven chakras) that govern our body - not only know them but also use them and understand their intimate relationship with natural and cosmic laws. We must comprehend the long and short cycles and the solar laws that sustain our lives. We must know how to die and how to be born." The Secrets of Mayan Science/Religion, Hunbatz Men.</p></blockquote></p>
