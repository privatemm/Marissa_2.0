                    <p>The purest flame is the violet flame. It comes from cleansing ourselves in Light. There are many people out there who give psychic readings and have not been through the furnace of life kicking their butt, refining who they are. When I was a child, an Angel in Holy light came to me, and it was from there in that pivotal moment that I accepted what I am meant to do. My life has been multifaceted and I have had my butt kicked, leading me to be the person I am today. As a child, I went to Body Mind &amp;Spirit expos, where I met my father and was adopted at an adolescent age by a Reiki Master Wise One, who knew I had raised myself as a child through intuitive gifts. From there I chose the path that is of most resistance. That path has led me to care about the growth of others and make it my life work to bring out their true self.</p>

                    <p>From the beginning I took many classes and learnt from my father, and am now certified as a Reiki Practitioner in Usui and Karuna, as a Crystal practitioner, and have taken the path of a Shaman practitioner. What certification matters the most? The one I see in my minds eye- not one on the wall. From the refining of the fire of my life's hardships, and the gifts given to me from birth to see, hear, feel messages from the other side. When someone passes, I can communicate with them. When your anxiety, hurt, or past attachments haunt you; that is where I come in to free you from that karmic illness. I am a doctor for the unseen.  </p>

                    <p>What has been most significant about my nearly 20 years of work is the growth I have seen in each person, as they rise from energy work and psychic consultation. Further, the way everyone comes in to my office with troubles, and each week their aura becomes brighter, their lives get better. That is why I do what I do.</p>

                    <p>Each one of us has an Aura. There are many layers to it. Each living thing has energy. Our auras hold energy we pick up from our lives, and can easily be damaged from day to day. Our auras reflect how healthy our energy centers are, known as chakras. When you accept work to revive these centers, you are opening yourself to balance and a release of negativity in your spirit. </p>

                    <p>Working to help those by combining techniques such as Intuitive Energy Healing, Reiki, Bioenergetic Field therapy, Shamanism techniques, I tailor my work to each individual and we create real life change. The things that we share in our world are far more valuable than those which divide us. I share my talents so you can find your purple flame of refining, and find what your spirit is driving you towards.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">The Energy of Reiki is always pure &amp; does not change its nature because of individual beliefs about it. Reiki sessions have positive results regardless of a person's perception on how &amp; why it works. </h2>
<p>Energy work is for the physical, mental, and emotional wellbeing. Reiki was founded by Doctor Usui Sensei in Japan and is based in the Life - Force that each one of us is given that makes us the Soul holding Humans that we are. Your Reiki Practitioner channels divine healing through this method. Hospitals use Reiki, because of the scientific proof of its works. It relies on a practitioner's inner guidance based in being attuned to such energy. Usui Sensei spoke of healing to be in the "divine state of Buddha," and he said, "It is generally thought to be very difficult for ordinary human beings to heal diseases. However the beauty of the spiritual heal- ing method that I have created is that it makes this possible." Do you believe in miracles? In the text A Course In Miracles, "The world we see merely reflects our own internal frame of reference- the dominant ideas, wishes and emotions in our minds. "Projection makes perception". "When you have been caught in the world of perception you are caught in a dream."</p>
