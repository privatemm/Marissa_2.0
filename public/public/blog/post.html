                    <p><em>The purest flame is the violet flame.</em> In Energy Healing, purifying of the practitioner is often done by igniting a spiritual violet flame. Burning away any negativity that may have touched our auras, the egg-shaped energy field that surrounds each person. A sapphire is a rare crystal that has been through extreme amounts of the earth's heat, and has been naturally refined to it's own unmatched beauty. The color of the sapphire is similar to that of the energy healing Reiki Practitioners surround themselves with. The sapphire itself has an identity I relate with. Working with angels, guardian angels {in the form of} spirit guides, and forms of spirit that originate with Our Creator {i.e. passed ones}; I communicate, heal, help ones into soul journey, and revive Spirit, Mind, and Body where everyone has some form of blockages - these are felt but most often not seen. 
                        <p>The indigenous believed diseases originated with spirits, and yes, the arrival of some have no explanation. We cannot directly explain why or how someone develops cancer and another doesn't, when under alike conditions. No one can really explain the origin of phobias. Yet, when the Spirit passes from a body, it leaves humanity and can be seen or heard by those with the gift. Who is to say we only live one life? Phobias and diseases {for example}, what we are in this life, could very well be a product of previous lives. In my Shamanic practice, I have taken individuals to places they have been before, and have helped them retrieve parts of who they are. There is healing in this, and helpful information that explains who we are today and what to do with this life. My entire life has always somehow been focused toward the goal of using my God-given gifts to help others. We sometimes cannot explain the absolute origin of recieving diseases or worse, and in the same way, we cannot explain the origin of the gifts of healing that come to us through energy work- physically, spiritually, mentally, or emotionally. We just know it works.</p> 
                    <h3>My path to spiritually-guided healing work has not been easy. I have been put through near-death experiences &amp; many tests from our Creator. Transformation made me who I am.</h3>
                    <p> I have been through the fire like a sapphire. I work through honesty and devotion, and I admit, my life has not been average and easy. There are many people out there who give psychic readings and have not been through the furnace of life- kicking their butt, refining who they are. They may just be visionaries. This is my story.</p> 
                           <p>When I was a child, an Angel in Magnificent Holy light came to me as clear as day, revealing to me in that pivotal moment that I needed to accept what I was meant to do- from before my life even began. I was too young to understand the message at the time, but it came to light as my gifts did. Creator has taught me lessons and put me on different paths leading me to be the person I am today. As a child, I went to Body Mind &amp; Spirit expos, where I met my father and was then adopted at an adolescent age by a wise Navajo man. He saw the hard childhood I had without me speaking a word. He has a doctorate in parapsychology, with claircognizant gifts who was already trained as a Reiki Master, Shaman Practitioner, and created his own Reiki through use of the indigenous medicine wheel. He knew I was a child going through so many hardships through his own God-given intuitive gifts. I was urged to hone my own God-given gifts as a healer and mentor in claircognizance. As a Christian without familial love, I was blessed with a new father and a new path. My life's path has led me to better understand how important every single one of us is in growth and make it my life work to help others heal and transcend barriers of the true self.</p>

                    <p>From the beginning of my work I took classes in Indianapolis and have learnt from amazing practitioners. I am now Certified as a Reiki Practitioner ( Angel, Usui and Karuna ), as a Crystal practitioner, and as a Shamanic practitioner, or a Medicine Woman. I combine my skills and talents to create a special and unique experience tailored to each important person I meet. Readings are a pinnacle in my work as a result of my intuitive gifts. What I do comes from the core of the refining fire in my life's hardships, the gifts given to me from birth to see, hear, feel Angels &amp; Spirit messages from the other side; and to channel energy to heal. When someone passes, I can communicate with them. When your anxiety, hurt, or past attachments leave blockages in your mental, emotional, physical, spiritual progress; I work with you to free you from any karmic illnesses. The heaviest burdens can be lifted off the things our eyes are incapable of seeing.  </p>

                    <p>What has been most significant about my nearly 20 years of work is the growth I have seen in each person, as they rise from energy work and psychic consultation. Further, the way an individual comes in to my office with troubles, and each week their aura becomes brighter, their lives get better. That is why I do what I do.</p>

                    <p>Each one of us has an Aura. There are many layers to it. Each living thing has energy. Our auras hold energy we pick up from our lives, and can easily be damaged from day to day. Our auras reflect how healthy our energy centers are, known as chakras. When you accept work to revive these centers, you are opening yourself to balance, and a release of all negativity in your spirit, body, &amp; mind. </p>

                    <p>Working to help those by combining techniques such as Intuitive Energy Healing, Reiki (Angel, Usui, Karuna), Bioenergetic Field therapy, and Medicine woman techniques, I tailor my work to each individual and we create real life change. The things that we share in our world are far more valuable than those which divide us. I share my skills so you can find PURPOSE, Closure, Understanding, TRANSFORMATION, and seek what your divine spirit is driving you towards.</p>
<h3 class="section-heading">Reiki Is..</h3>
                    <h3>The Energy of Reiki is always pure &amp; does not change its nature because of individual beliefs about it. Reiki sessions have positive results regardless of a person's perception on how &amp; why it works. </h3>
<p>Energy work is for the physical, mental, and emotional well-being. Reiki was founded by Doctor Usui Sensei in Japan and is based in the Life - Force that each one of us is given that makes us the Soul holding Humans that we are. Your Reiki Practitioner channels divine healing through this method. In my practice I create my own Reiki through many Reiki methods combined that I find bring amazing results, true to my work. Hospitals use Reiki, because of the scientific proof that its works. It relies on a practitioner's inner guidance based in being attuned to such energy. Usui Sensei spoke of healing to be in the "divine state of Buddha," and he said, "It is generally thought to be very difficult for ordinary human beings to heal diseases. However the beauty of the spiritual heal- ing method that I have created is that it makes this possible." Do you believe in miracles? In the text A Course In Miracles, "The world we see merely reflects our own internal frame of reference- the dominant ideas, wishes and emotions in our minds. "Projection makes perception". "When you have been caught in the world of perception you are caught in a dream." There is a solution I can offer towards a better quality life and mentality.

Are you feeling restless or dissatisfied? Are you tired of the struggle? What is ruling your inner and outer world? It might be time to give yourself a new perspective. You may be going through a spiritual transformation.

                    <span class="caption text-muted">A spiritual transformation is a journey that unites our personality with our soul’s purpose, giving us greater meaning in our lives. When we go through this deep transformation, we become more conscious. We gain more clarity and rid of old patterns that no longer serve us.

Embrace the Spiritual Transformation Program! There are infinite possibilities when you reach forward and surrender to spirit, letting go of ego. Ego is the opposite of your divine inner spirit. It is the voice in your head instead of the heart led advice that you can feel is right; that is from a higher plane. Let spirit be your guide, and try to let go of the "Yeah Right", or "This isnt real". That is your ego talking! Your heart may say something different, and like it or not, something spiritual led you to us today. Large or small, obstacles teach us to keep working forward. How you go forward from here should be with your divine inner Spirit! Learn more about the Spiritual Transformation Program that has changed lives. </span>
